Dear Users, 
Here you may find some step-by-step codes for MySQL, used for Database Management class. Always remember that it will not work directly the time you downlaoded it, tehre will always be a haste proccess ;)

To run in MySQL workbench, click the database icon, enter the password after pressing the ok button, and run the codes by highlighting a line, and clicking the thudner button

Yours,
Ryufath
