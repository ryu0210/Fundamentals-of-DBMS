# Fundamentals-of-DBMS

Dear Users, 
Here you may find some step-by-step codes for MySQL, used for Database Management class. Always remember that it will not work directly the time you downloaded it, there will always be a haste proccess ;)

To run in MySQL workbench, click the database icon, click ok, enter the password after pressing the ok button, and run the codes by highlighting a line, and clicking the thunder button after the selected highlight

Yours,
Ryufath
